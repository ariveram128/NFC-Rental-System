# RentScan Wi-Fi Setup Implementation README

This document outlines the files you need to add or modify to implement Wi-Fi functionality in the RentScan NFC Tag Rental System project.

## Files to Add

### 1. wifi_handler.h
**Location**: `main_application/include/`

**Purpose**: 
- Defines the public API for the Wi-Fi functionality
- Contains function declarations for:
  - Wi-Fi initialization
  - Network connection management
  - Connection status checking
  - Data transmission to server
- Provides a clean interface for the main application to use Wi-Fi features

### 2. wifi_handler.c
**Location**: `main_application/src/`

**Purpose**:
- Implements all Wi-Fi functionality declared in the header
- Manages the Wi-Fi network interface
- Handles connection and disconnection events
- Provides HTTP client functionality to communicate with backend servers
- Implements error handling and recovery mechanisms

## Files to Modify

### 1. prj.conf
**Purpose of modifications**:
- Enable networking subsystem in Zephyr
- Configure TCP/IP stack
- Enable Wi-Fi drivers and management
- Configure network buffers and memory allocation
- Enable HTTP client for server communication

**Key configurations to add**:
- Networking configurations
- Wi-Fi driver settings
- Network management event handling
- HTTP client support

### 2. main.c
**Purpose of modifications**:
- Include the new Wi-Fi header
- Initialize the Wi-Fi subsystem during startup
- Connect to a Wi-Fi network using credentials
- Send rental data over Wi-Fi when an NFC tag is detected
- Handle Wi-Fi connectivity errors appropriately

**Key additions**:
- Wi-Fi credentials definitions
- Initialization code
- Integration with NFC tag processing flow

### 3. CMakeLists.txt
**Purpose of modifications**:
- Add the new Wi-Fi handler source file to the build
- Ensure all required libraries are linked

## Implementation Requirements

The Wi-Fi implementation should:
1. Initialize properly on system startup
2. Connect to configured Wi-Fi networks automatically
3. Reconnect if the connection is lost
4. Provide clear status information on connection state
5. Efficiently transmit rental data to a backend server
6. Work alongside the existing BLE communication path
7. Use proper error handling and logging

## Hardware Considerations

- The implementation assumes Wi-Fi hardware is connected to the nRF52840DK
- Options include:
  - nRF7002 Expansion Board (preferred)
  - External ESP32/ESP8266 module connected via UART

## Testing Procedure

1. Build the project with the new Wi-Fi files
2. Flash to the primary nRF52840DK
3. Monitor logs to verify Wi-Fi initialization and connection
4. Test NFC tag scanning to ensure data is sent over Wi-Fi
5. Verify receipt of data on the backend server

Following these instructions will add Wi-Fi capability to your RentScan system, allowing it to communicate rental data directly to backend servers without relying solely on the BLE gateway.
