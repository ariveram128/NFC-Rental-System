# RentScan Project Status

## Current Status (April 21st, 2025)

### Project Structure
We've created a clean, modular structure that separates different parts of the system:
- `main_application/` - The core rental system
  - `src/` - Source code files
  - `include/` - Header files
  - `prj.conf` - Configuration settings
- `ble_gateway/` - The receiving device (central)
- `samples_reference/` - Original samples kept for reference
- `tests/` - Directory for test code
- `docs/` - Documentation

### Implementation Progress

#### NFC Functionality âœ…
- Successfully implemented NFC initialization with the internal NFCT peripheral
- Added proper hardware setup and callback handling
- NFC field detection is working correctly
- Created necessary prj.conf settings for NFC operation
- Simulated NDEF message reading with placeholder data

#### BLE Handler ðŸš§
- Created basic framework with placeholder functions
- Initialization function returns success but doesn't connect yet
- Header file defines future interfaces for data transmission

#### Rental Logic ðŸš§
- Created basic framework with placeholder implementation
- Function definitions in place for future business logic

### Terminal Log Confirmation
The application now successfully initializes and reports:
```
*** Booting nRF Connect SDK v2.5.1 ***
[00:00:00.449,615] <inf> main: RentScan application started
[00:00:00.449,645] <inf> nfc_handler: Initializing NFC reader
[00:00:00.449,645] <inf> nfc_handler: Initializing NFC T2T subsystem
[00:00:00.449,676] <inf> nfc_handler: NFC initialization successful
[00:00:00.449,707] <inf> nfc_handler: Starting NFC field polling
[00:00:00.449,707] <inf> nfc_handler: NFC polling started - waiting for tag detection
[00:00:00.449,737] <inf> nfc_handler: NFC reader initialization complete
[00:00:00.449,737] <inf> ble_handler: BLE subsystem initialization (placeholder)
[00:00:00.449,768] <inf> main: RentScan initialized and ready for NFC tags
```

When a tag is detected, we see:
```
[00:00:03.750,152] <inf> nfc_handler: NFC field detected
```

## Next Steps

### 1. Complete NFC Reading
- Implement actual NDEF message reading from detected tags
- Extract real text records from scanned tags
- Process the tag data and pass it to the rental logic

### 2. Implement BLE Communication
- Copy UART service from `peripheral_uart` sample
- Create function to send rental data over BLE
- Set up advertising with "RentScan" name
- Implement connection handling

### 3. Create Rental Business Logic
- Define rental data structure (item ID, start time, duration)
- Implement rental start/stop functionality
- Add expiration checking
- Handle edge cases (duplicate scans, etc.)

### 4. Complete BLE Gateway
- Modify scanning to look for "RentScan" devices
- Implement data receiving and parsing
- Add logging/forwarding to conceptual backend
- Test with PC or other DK board

### 5. Testing and Integration
- Test NFC reading independently âœ…
- Test BLE communication separately
- Integrate both components
- System-level testing with real NFC tags

## Getting Started

### Hardware Setup
- nRF52840 DK board
- NFC antenna connected to NFC1/NFC2 pins
- USB cable for power and debugging

### Software Requirements
- nRF Connect SDK v2.5.1
- nRF Connect for Desktop (Programmer app for flashing)
- Terminal application to view logs

### Building and Flashing
1. Open the project in nRF Connect for VS Code
2. Select the `main_application` directory
3. Click "Build Configuration" 
4. Select the nrf52840dk_nrf52840 board
5. Build the application
6. Flash to your device

### Testing
1. Connect the board to your computer
2. Open a terminal to view the logs (115200 baud)
3. Bring an NFC-enabled device or tag near the antenna
4. Verify the "NFC field detected" message appears

## Technical Details

### NFC Implementation
- Uses Type 2 Tag (T2T) functionality via nrfxlib
- Configured using the internal NFCT peripheral
- Event-driven architecture with callbacks
- Currently simulates tag data reading

### Known Limitations
- Currently only detects NFC fields but doesn't read actual tag data
- NDEF message parsing is implemented but not used with real data yet
- No integration with BLE communication

### Future Improvements
- Complete the tag data reading implementation
- Connect NFC data flow to rental logic
- Implement BLE communication for reporting rentals
